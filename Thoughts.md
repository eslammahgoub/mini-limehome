# Thoughts

- First I took time to read the documentation for both Google Map API && Here Map API. (This my first time to deal with maps).
- I did small stuff with Here Map 'cause I was like the API but finally I go with the Google Maps API. So you will realize that there is a liftover like the proxy config for the API and [hotel service].

# Times

8 hours

4 hours && 4 hours

2 hours for reading the documentation and init the application
and the rest to experiments and the magic :)

**NOTE**

When running the app on the localhost you should define your own `MAP_API_key` you can find that under the folder `src/environments/` in the environment file `mapApikeyGoogle` to make it works
